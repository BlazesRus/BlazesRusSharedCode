MFC base app code from Visual Studio Template:MFC App(Multiple configurations of MFC application added through use of preprocessor switches with Default features matching Tabbed Multiple documents with printer support)
with Options:
--[
-Multiple Document(Tabbed Documents)(Default)
Or Single Document (if BlazesMFCApp_UseSDI preprocessor enabled)
-MFC used in DLL(<UseOfMfc>Dynamic</UseOfMfc>)
-ProjectStyle MFC Standard (Native)
-Classic menu+Browser Toolbar
-Document/View Support
-Printer Support(Disabled if BlazesMFCApp_DisablePrinter preprocessor enabled)
-Common Control Manifest
]--
Other Features Toggled by Preprocessor(Added by me):
-Uses Local File to store filelist and saved settings instead of registry unless BlazesMFCApp_EnableRegistry preprocessor is enabled(BlazesMFCApp_UseRegistryStorage runs the default code that stores data in registry)
-Enable Output Window Features (from previous MFC project) if BlazesMFCApp_EnableOutputWindow
-Disable Tooltips by defining BlazesMFCApp_DisableTooltips

StaticTreeControl (https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9887/CViewTreeCtrl-A-CView-derived-custom-Tree-cont) derived code (derived from my BhvTreeEditor project)
used for some extra View code such as for TextView (View code is heavily changed from StaticTreeControl implimentation)
